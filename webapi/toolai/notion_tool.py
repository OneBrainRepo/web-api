We will be giving a ID and password to testers.Done by Onlizer’s side user will confirm authentication access to their Drive folders.This is the AI assistant dashboard to chat and connect additional apps)Email and password, confirm authenticity via email verification.User flow allows only one app signup first to get into the AI dashboard. After, they select additional apps using the connect app panel.After using up 18,000 tokens users can no longer be in the trial and a prompt has them buy a seat for continued use.We will be using Stripe as the payment gateChange password, delete account & update emailAdd additional email accounts for app access that you can switch back and forth withIf a user requests a task within a work app and wants to undo that action, they can delete it/undo it from a prompt (button)Under message response from the AI assistant each request shows a few buttons that give additional key words close to what the user requested to select and regenerate the response. This is in case they did not ask correctly the content they need.User can edit the message and regenerate the response.Users will be able to write OneBrain directing in their Slack interfaceThis will be utilizing OneBrain’s LLM that is finetuned and trained for language module purposes. This NLP model will be fine tuned according to the needs of Artsounds. Collected information about personas or characters(such as Transformer Optimus Prime) will be used for fine-tuning AI model to get responses based on persona.This part is mentioned in the paragraph 4 in the Product roadmap section. This part is unclear and is not definitive enough to describe the requirements.We need to describe about what kind of image recognition is required and how data will be transmitted from AR to CNN back and forthEach API will allow the AI to access from the user’s data permissions. For example, through Whatsapp, their conversations between the user and others will allow access so that the transformer assistant knows the dialog. Regarding to Youtube and Tikok, this also will include history and own personal uploaded videos. Regarding the schools system. We will need to figure out which apps are most popular. I am not sure there is a universal app for all school use and this could be quite fractioned market for educational apps. So this could be the top 5 that are universally used we connect to. Calendar/email is quite straight forward. Would be good to hear how many students between 14/18 use email and which email provider.With your lead on the visual designs (we can also help draft it up and give feedback) we will develop the frontend and backend of the application utilizing Next JS for the frontend and Python for the backend.  We can also implement those in other technologies per discussion.Budget:8 Month TimelineNLP Model Development(Feature Engineering & Data Collection)- 75 500 $NLP Model Training & Optimization  - 50 000 $NLP for chat functionality  (NLP Fine Tuning) - 8000 $NLP API & Hosting -  1500 $Front End Interface Web -  3500$Backend Services & Backend API (Users,Subscriptions etc..) -5 000 $Product UX/UI support - 3500$Q/A testing - 3000$$150,000Additional support:After the build and launch we will support maintenance until you find additional development support. In addition we can train new developers who you bring on your team to take the lead for the white label handover. We can discuss what additional costs this will be associated with.AI lead - SerdarFrontend lead - Kiril (full stack developer)Backend lead - (hiree) We have the people in mind we want to add one more person to support this build to the OneBrain teamProduct UX/UI & Q/A lead - EthanAdditional Information to get the ball rolling :We will be able to provide you with some basic NLP model in the beginning as a demo. We can launch this product and host it on our side. You can test it and show it to also your investors and partners.Ideally we can develop a small interface, a web based application where you can click on couple personas(Such as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumble Bee etc) and chat with those personas directly. AI bot will imitiate and act and respond like it is one of those characters. This manner you can also showcase your demo and get a feedback for the product as well. We will use already existing LLM model and fine tune according to the online available data. It will use small dataset and will be able to provide good content. This one will not contain any User login or similar functions. It will be directly available chat application for your showcase and demo purposes. This can be done in less then 3 weeks. Doing this will show you our capabilities for building the product and working closely with you.This is a draft mentioning what should be in the contract and will be improved upon OneBrain and Onlizer discussion to finalize such a contractThis agreement will be translated into a shareholders agreement on registering the OneBrain Company. The agreement is as follows:For the demo of the product and market ready preparations for launch, Onlizer will receive 5% equity. By the time OneBrain successfully acquires capital to allocate a service budget OneBrain will pay per usage at a decided (BLANK) rate between OneBrain and Onlizer.  Once OneBrain begins paying for the service OneBrain can decide to purchase back, ½ of equity at the current company valuation according to the last investment round. Therefore, Onlizer will have 2.5% fully vested shares for their own company holdings. OneBrain will have a pay as you go plan for a 3 year cooperation agreement (paid monthly). OneBrain and Onlizer together can extend such cooperation agreement upon a personal written contract.If Onlizer is not able to provide the free service support as requested before OneBrain can allocate a budget, these shares will deem invalid.This is current understanding of needs to support OneBrain’s integration. Discussion between Onlizer and OneBrain may change such request. However, here are the following ideas to support the service:Onlizer ConnectOnlizer Connection APIThe demo will be the first service support OneBrain will need. Below is a run through of each product needed for OneBrain to be market ready after the demo:Onlizer Connect - This will be used to hold API tokens and is needed for the final product and demoOnlizer Sync - Clients are expected to either need information stored from their side or from your cloud side. Thus, Onebrain will need such service. Not every company will use this, so this will be towards a future pay as you go plan.Connection API - if clients want the simplest connection solution, this service will be needed. And must be implemented in the demo.Onlizer Services - Support for additional services provided by Onlizer which is is shown below. These services will be part of a development plan and should be provided by Onlizer after request by OneBrain.Onlizer AppxOnlizer Custom ServicesBoth OneBrain and Onlizer will share customer leads and data to support each others customer growth.Termination Clause:Although it is of both business interests to keep a strong partnership, in caseNote: All shareholder’s will be proned to % equity dilution through investment rounds. This agreement will be attached to an email between Serdar, Ethan and Andriy with a reply confirming the agreement. An email reply represents the same as a signed signature.Architecture ok, funneling channelThis agreement will be translated into a shareholders agreement on registering the OneBrain Company. The agreement is as follows:One year advisory, indicatively checking in once a week with founders for research and network introductions. Vesting will occur each month according to the date this contract was agreed upon. This will lead to an Executive position if both founders are happy with the support. Founder can also use your name as CPO within the pitch deck following this agreement.Labeled as CPO of OneBrain, Paolo’s position will do the following:After year one working within the 8 hour a day structure at a minimum $140K Kc monthly salary or 70K Kc 4 hours a day salary, ⅕ of equity will be vested. Keep in mind, if full time is offered by OneBrain at 140K Kc Paolo must accept in order to continue vesting shares. Failure to accept will deem all shares invalid.If the company exits either through a merger, acquisition or IPO all shares will be vested.The year cliff begins (PUT DATE), 2023 to (PUT DATE) 2023. After this, every month equity will vest starting (PUT DATE) 2024. Equity will be fully vested by (PUT DATE) 2028.Note: All shareholder’s will be proned to % equity dilution through investment rounds. This agreement will be attached to an email between Serdar, Ethan and Paolo with a reply confirming the agreement. An email reply represents the same as a signed signature.Hello #firstName,I hope you’re doing well.

Much appreciated.This agreement will be translated into a shareholders agreement on registering the OneBrain Company and when proper capital allows fees for a lawyer. The agreement is as followed:Labeled as an advisor to OneBrain which will be showcased in OneBrain materials such as business plan, website and pitch deck. In return, showcasing advisory role via Linkedin (once company is formed). Consultancy and networking support will be the following:The advisory role will involve providing guidance and validation of the business model and the product  (which includes but is limited to strategies such as go-to-market, product, marketing, revenue streams & company operations best practices).Introductions to potential angel investors, accelerators or venture capitalists to support seed round raise and future following rounds. Promote the benefits of OneBrain to these investors you meet or in connection with that would make a good fit to OneBrain.Whenever at events or get connected through 3rd parties of any SMEs suitable for OneBrain, recommend us.Must respond to requests of questions for advice coming from founders either via 1:1 meetings or messaging. This is in the form of bi-weekly check in calls for 1:1, and to reply in a reasonable time frame to messages coming from the founders of OneBrain.If a new investor joins the team dilution will occur for all shareholders. For example, if AgorApp allocates 20% of the company to an investor, all current shareholders will be diluted by 20% as showcased from the following equation:Total share amount * new share % decimal - total share amount = diluted sharesExample if owning 0.5% equity:0.5*0.20 = (0.1)0.5 - (0.1) = 0.4%In the event that either OneBrain or the Advisor fail to comply with their responsibilities as outlined in this agreement, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the matter amicably through good faith negotiations. However, if such attempts are unsuccessful,  the parties - OneBrain and/or the Advisor- reserve the right to terminate the agreement within one year from signing the present contract.By signing here or responding “agreed” to an email with this contract attached will officially make the agreement valid between Robert De Groot and OneBrain (signed by Founders Ethan Clime and Serdar Aslantürk).Robert De Groot (Advisor)Date: _____________________              Signature:_____________________Ethan Clime  (CEO of OneBrain)Date: _____________________              Signature:_____________________Serdar Aslantürk   (CTO of OneBrain)Date: _____________________              Signature:_____________________Potential leads:List of 100 HR tech companies:I am looking for the perfect initial industry  to launch my new startup, that the startup would address the most pressing needs and would have the highest rate of adoption.
