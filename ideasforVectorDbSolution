1 - Use in memory vectordb 
Use specific collection name
Identify the collection and after usage call delete _collection option and test it

2 - dbtest = Chroma(client=client, collection_name=collection_name)
AttributeError: 'Chroma' object has no attribute '_client_settings'

This error can be due to error in mismatch between library versions, normally

if client is not None:
            self._client = client
        else:
            if client_settings:
                self._client_settings = client_settings

And chromadb client is accepted to the client part, strangely it does not work for now 

Chromadb still works on memory but we can erase the database after usage
